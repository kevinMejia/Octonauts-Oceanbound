# Development backlog

Read this record with AGENTS.md at session start. Keep active scope, authorization,
dependencies, verification, and the next action current. A backlog entry alone is
not implementation approval. This is not a background scheduler.

## Active task

| ID | Request | Priority | Authorization | Status | Dependency / next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WORKFLOW-002 | Noninterrupting request queue, project instructions, and persistent backlog | Current | Explicit user implementation request | Verifying | Independently review AGENTS.md and this record; open a separate infrastructure PR |

Scope: instructions and backlog only; no gameplay changes. Branch:
`chore/non-interrupting-request-queue`. The Project Manager triaged this as the next
already-authorized task after camera delivery. Existing AGENTS.md instructions
are preserved; the new section adds queue handling, approval boundaries, and
interruption recovery.

## Queue, in priority order

No additional feature requests, bug reports, or improvement ideas are queued.
Do not automatically start new work. For each incoming request, add a row with:

| ID | Request / scope | Priority | Authorization | Status | Dependencies / next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Use `proposed`, `queued`, `active`, `verifying`, `blocked`, or `delivered`. Have the
Project Manager triage requests and record the recommendation. A recommendation
to include a request in current scope still needs explicit user approval before
implementation. Explicitly approved work does not require repeated approval.

## Delivered work and remaining verification

| ID | Request | Delivery | Verification / qualifications |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CAMERA-001 | Fix GUP-X steep-slope camera and driving view | [PR #2](https://github.com/kevinMejia/Octonauts-Oceanbound/pull/2), open and unmerged; branch `fix/gup-x-steep-slope-camera` | Independent QA passed; physical iPhone verification and documented rendering limits remain |

Camera checkpoint: commit `c64de6d796fd2908995bdf7cf31412fee81dfc9b`. Real Project
Manager, Game Developer, and QA subagents ran. QA's blocking terrain-ahead
visibility finding was fixed and independently re-reviewed. All 55 test files,
15 focused camera cases, production build, and six exact underwater camera
snapshots passed. Actual local Chromium driving/orbit checks and real pointer
drag/recenter ran. Corrected final captures show a clear 28.86° slope in both
directions and a 41.42° uphill view; evidence and diagnostics are in the camera PR.

The original location still has partial decorative-reef overlap, and extreme
close-distance/narrow-FOV portrait side views can crop the hull. These are
documented qualifications, not evidence of an invalid physics spawn. Physical
iPhone Safari feel, sustained frame pacing/thermal behavior, portrait framing,
and simultaneous steering/orbit touch remain untested. Airborne coverage is
synthetic; the existing tracked controller has no jump mechanic. No merge or
deployment occurred. These notes do not authorize a new implementation task.

## Resuming and updating this record

Inspect the active branch/PR, subagent results, and tool outcomes, then resume the
active task from its last completed step. An interrupted tool call may already
have changed remote state; inspect before retrying a mutation. Preserve progress
and active agents rather than restarting. Record new requests before considering
their implementation and briefly acknowledge them while continuing approved work.

At independent QA completion and requested PR delivery, present the queue in
priority order. Mark a task delivered when its requested PR is open and reviewed;
that does not imply merge or deployment. Keep remaining verification and known
limits visible. Do not start an unapproved queued task automatically.
